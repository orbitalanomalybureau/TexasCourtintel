      "demographicsBlurb": "Bexar County (pop. ~2.09M) is majority Hispanic (59.8%) with substantial bilingual households (37.7% speak a language other than English at home). Median age is 35.0; bachelor's+ attainment is 32.8%; median household income is about $69.8k with 14.7% below poverty, supporting large, mixed urban/suburban jury pools and damages narratives that can vary materially by venue within the county.",
      "politicalBlurb": "Countywide elections have leaned Democratic in recent cycles (driven by San Antonio urban core), while outer suburban precincts remain more competitive and can tighten judicial/down-ballot margins. For trial strategy, assume partisan heterogeneity by precinct and ballot position rather than a uniform countywide profile.",

Bachelor's+ attainment is 20.7%; median household income is about $53.7k; poverty is 27.2%. These indicators are litigation-relevant for communication style, economic-loss framing, and practical access-to-care/workforce evidence.",

Practically, counsel should not treat the county as a static partisan environment; precinct-level shifts and turnout volatility can materially affect jury composition and narrative resonance.",
